# ShardCalculator
A legacy application for players of the classic MMORPG Tibia. Allows players to maximize the value of the in-game item "Midnight Shard" during a yearly event.

I'm not the player "Sirhic" on the game Tibia. Please do not bother that player thinking this.

This requires .NET Framework 4.0 to build or run. Please see the license on terms for modifying the software.

The "Midnight Shard" image and icon is property of and copyrighted by CipSoft GmbH.
