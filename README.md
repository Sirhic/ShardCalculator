# ShardCalculator
A legacy application for players of the classic MMORPG Tibia. Allows players to maximize the value of the in-game item "Midnight Shard" during a yearly event.

I'm not the player "Sirhic" on the game Tibia. Please do not bother that player thinking this.

This requires .NET Framework 4.0 to build or run. Please see the license on terms for modifying the software.

To use this software, enter a character's current level, current experience, and the total number of midnight shards to use, and press the Calculate button. The levels and number of shards that are required will be listed in the box on the right side. The bottom text box will contain the remaining experience to the next level after all the shards specified are used.
